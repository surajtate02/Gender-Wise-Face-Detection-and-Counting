# Gender-Wise-Face-Detection-and-Counting
we are going to learn how to build a computer vision and deep learning combination application. Which performs gender wise face recognition with opencv and counts the people in the image or in the video.  In other words with the help of deep learning and computer vision algorithms using python opencv as a modeling package, we will classify the gender  and count the faces for a given image/video.  Building these kinds of models makes life easier with the enhancements over the deep learning field.  Nowadays deep learning field is one of the most revolutionary technologies with rapid enhancement growth. It gives machines the ability to think and learn on their own. The key motivation for deep learning is to build algorithms that mimic the human brain.
